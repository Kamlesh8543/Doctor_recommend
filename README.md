# Doctor_recommend
Doctor recommendation system is a very useful and emerging area in data science and health informatics. In recent time many approaches and applications have been proposed in this direction. This paper presents a simple prototype of recommending a doctor using classification based models. In the proposed approach patientsâ€™ information and preferences are selected as input to train the model and using classification algorithms a suitable doctor is recommended. In this work probability-based classifier and decision tree-based classifiers are used for recommending a doctor and a comparative study is also presented between them.
